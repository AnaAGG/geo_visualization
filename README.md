# Workshop de Geovisualización en Ironhack 
![portada](https://github.com/agalvezcorell/geo_visualization/blob/main/images/geo_portada.jpg)

We are introduced to geovisualisation by explaining some basic concepts of Folium, GeoJSON, Geodataframes and Cartoframes.
We program in python and use jupyter notebook technology to make it easier for students to follow the class.


### What will you find?

- 1_folium.ipynb
In this notebook we look at the basics of the Folium library and learn how to create maps. We add markers through a dataframe and we also create heatmaps.

- 2_coropletico.ipynb
In this notebook we are introduced to the concept of geojson and paint a choropleth map.

- 3_geo_dataframe.ipynb
In this notebook we work with the geopandas library and learn how to make a geodataframe and paint a basic map with the Cartoframes library.
